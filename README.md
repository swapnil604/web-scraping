# web-scraping
Data collection is one of the most crucial stage of any data science project. Sometimes finding a sample dataset according to one's need is an extremely tedious task. Web scraping allows us to extract data from a desired website. In this project, we used a very popular python library called 'BeautifulSoup' which allows us to achieve the same. This project also includes feature to save the extracted data in an excel sheet. 

NOTE: Scraping the website was only meant for educational purpose.
