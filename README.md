# web-scraping

Data collection is one of the most crucial stage of any data science project. Sometimes finding a sample dataset according to one's need is an extremely tedious task. Web scraping allows us to extract data from a desired website. Here we're getting the top rated weekly restaurants in Pune from Swiggy in which we used a very popular python library called 'BeautifulSoup' which allows us to achieve the same. This project also includes feature to save the extracted data in an excel sheet format.

NOTE: Scraping the website in this project was only meant for educational purpose.
